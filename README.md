Efficient near realtime animation of soundwave and simulatenous 
playback of audio, primarily for use in Jupyter notebooks. 
Approximately 10x faster than naive matplotlib animation approaches.
Guarantees no out of sync audio by quickly rendering as an MPEG4 video.
Time to render 30 FPS, 0.25 second viewport over a 7 second clip is 
approximately 2-3 seconds.
